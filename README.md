# Psion Time Machine

Psion Time Capsule is a web app that lets users explore archived Psion-related websites from the late '90s and early 2000s. Built from URLs found on old CD-ROMs, it offers a glimpse into the personal homepages of developers and uncovers forgotten apps from the early days of mobile computing.
